# ***ALL HAIL THE MEOC!***

In the pursuit of knowledge I have used Vincents Meoc's Tito App work extensively. This is my attempt to give back.

My goal in this "Custom" version of his docker deployment files is take what I have learned and add more value. Giving back.

To that end I have changed the docker-compose files to accept environment variables, and added a .env to for the docker-compose to consume. To make this yur own simply change the variables in .env to suit you.
